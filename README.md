# News_Summary
This project aims to gather a collection of news form The Guardian Api's, the user can then see a summery of the headlines and navigate on a news of choice.
This app is a frontend, single page app, so that the browser never refreshes the page. This means that, once the page loads, all changes happen by inserting HTML into the existing page.
For this project no testing frame work has been used but I have worked on creating my own.
